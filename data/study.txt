Students from outside the EU/EEA must apply for a residence permit to study in Finland. The permit requires proof of acceptance to a Finnish institution, adequate funds, and health insurance.

The application can be submitted online via the Enter Finland service. Typically, it covers full-time studies at a university or university of applied sciences.

After graduation, students may apply for an extended permit to look for work.
