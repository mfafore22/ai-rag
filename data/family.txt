If you are a Finnish resident, your spouse, registered partner, or child can apply for a residence permit for family reunification.

Applicants must show proof of the relationship, financial support, and housing. The sponsor (the family member in Finland) must have sufficient income to support the applicant.

Processing may take several months and may involve interviews or additional documentation.
