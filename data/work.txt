To apply for a residence permit based on work, you must have a job in Finland. Your employer must ensure that the vacancy cannot be filled by someone already in the labor market. The application process includes submitting proof of employment, income, and housing.

You may apply for a work-based permit if you are employed in sectors like IT, healthcare, agriculture, or hospitality. The employer initiates the application process in the Enter Finland portal.

Processing time may vary, and additional documents may be requested by Migri.
